    VSDS & Secuirty Module by ninjaninja140 and eledontlie.

    Hello! Welcome to VSDS, appears you've stumbled across this module because you're either looking at what reqires
    our products make in the output, you're either snooping through our stuff or maybe you're just a developer at Virtua
    or any random developer looking through our scripts!

    VSDS is not open source.
    Neither will it ever.
    (Excluding specific scripts to be left as open source)

    VSDS is too high priority for me (ninjaninja140) to make it public, it's taken way too much time to develop just to
    make this an open source project, no way.

    But anyways, for security purpouses pretty much every script inside VSDS is obfuscated, including the majority of
    the products inside VSDS. There's a chanse some may not be obfuscated, but most of them are anyway for security.
    VSDS does not intend to cause issues within peoples games maliciously, users may be kicked if they are blacklisted
    or have their products deactivated by our module, and thats only how far we intend to go. VSDS has not been built
    and obfuscated with the intent to mask malicious scripts or content that may harm users in any way.

    To utilise VSDS for Virtua Products, use the example below to load a product:
    (This example assumes that the product properties and instanced are arranged in the official model)
    require(16582923129).Deploy(script, "PRODUCT NAME", "PRODUCT SCRIPT NAME")
    
    NOTE: If the script does not load properly, check the GitHub repository shown below to check on the most recent release
          if the script exists or you can check Virtua's Comm Server Announcements channel for an announced downtime or bug notice.

            This VSDS uses a custom obfuscator, if you somehow crack it please DM me with any improvements to make!
            I'm always open to learning about insecurities in my obfuscator to learn how to make it better, DMing me would help a lot instead of leaking, thank you!
